postgresql-8.4 (8.4.22-0+deb6u1) squeeze-lts; urgency=low

  8.4.22 marks the end of life of the PostgreSQL 8.4 branch. No further
  releases will be made by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group.

  Users of PostgreSQL 8.4 should look into upgrading to a newer PostgreSQL
  release. Options are:

  * Upgrading to Debian 7 (Wheezy), providing postgresql-9.1.

  * The use of the apt.postgresql.org repository, providing packages for all
    active PostgreSQL branches (9.0 up to 9.4 at the time of writing).

    See https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt for more information about the
    repository.

    A helper script to activate the repository is provided in
    /usr/share/doc/postgresql-8.4/examples/apt.postgresql.org.sh.

  * An LTS version of 8.4 is in planning that will cover the lifetime of
    squeeze-lts. Updates will probably made on a best-effort basis. Users can
    take advantage of this, but should still consider upgrading to newer
    PostgreSQL versions over the next months.
