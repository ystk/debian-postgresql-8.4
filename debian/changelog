postgresql-8.4 (8.4.13-0squeeze1) stable-security; urgency=low

  * New upstream security/bug fix release:
    - Prevent access to external files/URLs via XML entity references.
      xml_parse() would attempt to fetch external files or URLs as needed
      to resolve DTD and entity references in an XML value, thus allowing
      unprivileged database users to attempt to fetch data with the
      privileges of the database server. While the external data wouldn't
      get returned directly to the user, portions of it could be exposed
      in error messages if the data didn't parse as valid XML; and in any
      case the mere ability to check existence of a file might be useful
      to an attacker. (CVE-2012-3489)
    - Prevent access to external files/URLs via "contrib/xml2"'s
      xslt_process().
      libxslt offers the ability to read and write both files and URLs
      through stylesheet commands, thus allowing unprivileged database
      users to both read and write data with the privileges of the
      database server. Disable that through proper use of libxslt's
      security options. (CVE-2012-3488)
      Also, remove xslt_process()'s ability to fetch documents and
      stylesheets from external files/URLs. While this was a documented
      "feature", it was long regarded as a bad idea. The fix for
      CVE-2012-3489 broke that capability, and rather than expend effort
      on trying to fix it, we're just going to summarily remove it.
    - Prevent too-early recycling of btree index pages.
      When we allowed read-only transactions to skip assigning XIDs, we
      introduced the possibility that a deleted btree page could be
      recycled while a read-only transaction was still in flight to it.
      This would result in incorrect index search results. The
      probability of such an error occurring in the field seems very low
      because of the timing requirements, but nonetheless it should be
      fixed.
    - Fix crash-safety bug with newly-created-or-reset sequences.
      If "ALTER SEQUENCE" was executed on a freshly created or reset
      sequence, and then precisely one nextval() call was made on it, and
      then the server crashed, WAL replay would restore the sequence to a
      state in which it appeared that no nextval() had been done, thus
      allowing the first sequence value to be returned again by the next
      nextval() call. In particular this could manifest for serial
      columns, since creation of a serial column's sequence includes an
      "ALTER SEQUENCE OWNED BY" step.
    - Ensure the "backup_label" file is fsync'd after pg_start_backup().
    - Back-patch 9.1 improvement to compress the fsync request queue.
      This improves performance during checkpoints. The 9.1 change has
      now seen enough field testing to seem safe to back-patch.
    - Only allow autovacuum to be auto-canceled by a directly blocked
      process.
      The original coding could allow inconsistent behavior in some
      cases; in particular, an autovacuum could get canceled after less
      than deadlock_timeout grace period.
    - Improve logging of autovacuum cancels.
    - Fix log collector so that log_truncate_on_rotation works during the
      very first log rotation after server start.
    - Fix WITH attached to a nested set operation
      (UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT).
    - Ensure that a whole-row reference to a subquery doesn't include any
      extra GROUP BY or ORDER BY columns.
    - Disallow copying whole-row references in CHECK constraints and
      index definitions during "CREATE TABLE".
      This situation can arise in "CREATE TABLE" with LIKE or INHERITS.
      The copied whole-row variable was incorrectly labeled with the row
      type of the original table not the new one. Rejecting the case
      seems reasonable for LIKE, since the row types might well diverge
      later. For INHERITS we should ideally allow it, with an implicit
      coercion to the parent table's row type; but that will require more
      work than seems safe to back-patch.
    - Fix memory leak in ARRAY(SELECT ...) subqueries.
    - Fix extraction of common prefixes from regular expressions.
      The code could get confused by quantified parenthesized
      subexpressions, such as ^(foo)?bar. This would lead to incorrect
      index optimization of searches for such patterns.
    - Fix bugs with parsing signed "hh":"mm" and "hh":"mm":"ss" fields in
      interval constants.
    - Report errors properly in "contrib/xml2"'s xslt_process().

postgresql-8.4 (8.4.12-0squeeze1) stable-security; urgency=low

  * New upstream security/bug fix release:
    - Fix incorrect password transformation in "contrib/pgcrypto"'s DES
      crypt() function.
      If a password string contained the byte value 0x80, the remainder
      of the password was ignored, causing the password to be much weaker
      than it appeared. With this fix, the rest of the string is properly
      included in the DES hash. Any stored password values that are
      affected by this bug will thus no longer match, so the stored
      values may need to be updated. (CVE-2012-2143)
    - Ignore SECURITY DEFINER and SET attributes for a procedural
      language's call handler.
      Applying such attributes to a call handler could crash the server.
      (CVE-2012-2655)
    - Allow numeric timezone offsets in timestamp input to be up to 16
      hours away from UTC.
      Some historical time zones have offsets larger than 15 hours, the
      previous limit. This could result in dumped data values being
      rejected during reload.
    - Fix timestamp conversion to cope when the given time is exactly the
      last DST transition time for the current timezone.
      This oversight has been there a long time, but was not noticed
      previously because most DST-using zones are presumed to have an
      indefinite sequence of future DST transitions.
    - Fix text to name and char to name casts to perform string
      truncation correctly in multibyte encodings.
    - Fix memory copying bug in to_tsquery().
    - Fix planner's handling of outer PlaceHolderVars within subqueries.
      This bug concerns sub-SELECTs that reference variables coming from
      the nullable side of an outer join of the surrounding query. In
      9.1, queries affected by this bug would fail with "ERROR:
      Upper-level PlaceHolderVar found where not expected". But in 9.0
      and 8.4, you'd silently get possibly-wrong answers, since the value
      transmitted into the subquery wouldn't go to null when it should.
    - Fix slow session startup when pg_attribute is very large.
      If pg_attribute exceeds one-fourth of shared_buffers, cache
      rebuilding code that is sometimes needed during session start would
      trigger the synchronized-scan logic, causing it to take many times
      longer than normal. The problem was particularly acute if many new
      sessions were starting at once.
    - Ensure sequential scans check for query cancel reasonably often.
      A scan encountering many consecutive pages that contain no live
      tuples would not respond to interrupts meanwhile.
    - Ensure the Windows implementation of PGSemaphoreLock() clears
      ImmediateInterruptOK before returning.
      This oversight meant that a query-cancel interrupt received later
      in the same query could be accepted at an unsafe time, with
      unpredictable but not good consequences.
    - Show whole-row variables safely when printing views or rules.
      Corner cases involving ambiguous names (that is, the name could be
      either a table or column name of the query) were printed in an
      ambiguous way, risking that the view or rule would be interpreted
      differently after dump and reload. Avoid the ambiguous case by
      attaching a no-op cast.
    - Fix "COPY FROM" to properly handle null marker strings that
      correspond to invalid encoding.
      A null marker string such as E'\\0' should work, and did work in
      the past, but the case got broken in 8.4.
    - Ensure autovacuum worker processes perform stack depth checking
      properly.
      Previously, infinite recursion in a function invoked by
      auto-"ANALYZE" could crash worker processes.
    - Fix logging collector to not lose log coherency under high load.
      The collector previously could fail to reassemble large messages if
      it got too busy.
    - Fix logging collector to ensure it will restart file rotation after
      receiving SIGHUP.
    - Fix WAL replay logic for GIN indexes to not fail if the index was
      subsequently dropped>
    - Fix memory leak in PL/pgSQL's "RETURN NEXT" command.
    - Fix PL/pgSQL's "GET DIAGNOSTICS" command when the target is the
      function's first variable.
    - Fix potential access off the end of memory in psql's expanded
      display ("\x") mode.
    - Fix several performance problems in pg_dump when the database
      contains many objects.
      pg_dump could get very slow if the database contained many schemas,
      or if many objects are in dependency loops, or if there are many
      owned sequences.
    - Fix "contrib/dblink"'s dblink_exec() to not leak temporary database
      connections upon error.
    - Fix "contrib/dblink" to report the correct connection name in error
      messages.
  * debian/patches/15-revert-typmod-check.patch: Unfuzz to apply to new
    version.
  * debian/control: Move bzr branches to alioth, so that other members of
    pkg-postgresql can commit. Update Vcs-* tags.

postgresql-8.4 (8.4.11-0squeeze1) stable-security; urgency=high

  * New upstream bug fix/security release:
    - Require execute permission on the trigger function for "CREATE
      TRIGGER".
      This missing check could allow another user to execute a trigger
      function with forged input data, by installing it on a table he
      owns. This is only of significance for trigger functions marked
      SECURITY DEFINER, since otherwise trigger functions run as the
      table owner anyway. (CVE-2012-0866)
    - Remove arbitrary limitation on length of common name in SSL
      certificates.
      Both libpq and the server truncated the common name extracted from
      an SSL certificate at 32 bytes. Normally this would cause nothing
      worse than an unexpected verification failure, but there are some
      rather-implausible scenarios in which it might allow one
      certificate holder to impersonate another. The victim would have to
      have a common name exactly 32 bytes long, and the attacker would
      have to persuade a trusted CA to issue a certificate in which the
      common name has that string as a prefix. Impersonating a server
      would also require some additional exploit to redirect client
      connections. (CVE-2012-0867)
    - Convert newlines to spaces in names written in pg_dump comments.
      pg_dump was incautious about sanitizing object names that are
      emitted within SQL comments in its output script. A name containing
      a newline would at least render the script syntactically incorrect.
      Maliciously crafted object names could present a SQL injection risk
      when the script is reloaded. (CVE-2012-0868)
    - Fix btree index corruption from insertions concurrent with
      vacuuming.
      An index page split caused by an insertion could sometimes cause a
      concurrently-running "VACUUM" to miss removing index entries that
      it should remove. After the corresponding table rows are removed,
      the dangling index entries would cause errors (such as "could not
      read block N in file ...") or worse, silently wrong query results
      after unrelated rows are re-inserted at the now-free table
      locations. This bug has been present since release 8.2, but occurs
      so infrequently that it was not diagnosed until now. If you have
      reason to suspect that it has happened in your database, reindexing
      the affected index will fix things.
    - Update per-column permissions, not only per-table permissions, when
      changing table owner.
      Failure to do this meant that any previously granted column
      permissions were still shown as having been granted by the old
      owner. This meant that neither the new owner nor a superuser could
      revoke the now-untraceable-to-table-owner permissions.
    - Allow non-existent values for some settings in "ALTER USER/DATABASE
      SET".
      Allow default_text_search_config, default_tablespace, and
      temp_tablespaces to be set to names that are not known. This is
      because they might be known in another database where the setting
      is intended to be used, or for the tablespace cases because the
      tablespace might not be created yet. The same issue was previously
      recognized for search_path, and these settings now act like that
      one.
    - Avoid crashing when we have problems deleting table files
      post-commit.
      Dropping a table should lead to deleting the underlying disk files
      only after the transaction commits. In event of failure then (for
      instance, because of wrong file permissions) the code is supposed
      to just emit a warning message and go on, since it's too late to
      abort the transaction. This logic got broken as of release 8.4,
      causing such situations to result in a PANIC and an unrestartable
      database.
    - Track the OID counter correctly during WAL replay, even when it
      wraps around.
      Previously the OID counter would remain stuck at a high value until
      the system exited replay mode. The practical consequences of that
      are usually nil, but there are scenarios wherein a standby server
      that's been promoted to master might take a long time to advance
      the OID counter to a reasonable value once values are needed.
    - Fix regular expression back-references with - attached.
      Rather than enforcing an exact string match, the code would
      effectively accept any string that satisfies the pattern
      sub-expression referenced by the back-reference symbol.
      A similar problem still afflicts back-references that are embedded
      in a larger quantified expression, rather than being the immediate
      subject of the quantifier. This will be addressed in a future
      PostgreSQL release.
    - Fix recently-introduced memory leak in processing of inet/cidr
      values.
    - Fix dangling pointer after "CREATE TABLE AS"/"SELECT INTO" in a
      SQL-language function.
      In most cases this only led to an assertion failure in
      assert-enabled builds, but worse consequences seem possible.
    - Fix I/O-conversion-related memory leaks in plpgsql.
    - Improve pg_dump's handling of inherited table columns.
      pg_dump mishandled situations where a child column has a different
      default expression than its parent column. If the default is
      textually identical to the parent's default, but not actually the
      same (for instance, because of schema search path differences) it
      would not be recognized as different, so that after dump and
      restore the child would be allowed to inherit the parent's default.
      Child columns that are NOT NULL where their parent is not could
      also be restored subtly incorrectly.
    - Fix pg_restore's direct-to-database mode for INSERT-style table
      data.
      Direct-to-database restores from archive files made with
      "--inserts" or "--column-inserts" options fail when using
      pg_restore from a release dated September or December 2011, as a
      result of an oversight in a fix for another problem. The archive
      file itself is not at fault, and text-mode output is okay.
    - Allow AT option in ecpg DEALLOCATE statements.
      The infrastructure to support this has been there for awhile, but
      through an oversight there was still an error check rejecting the
      case.
    - Fix error in "contrib/intarray"'s int[] & int[] operator.
      If the smallest integer the two input arrays have in common is 1,
      and there are smaller values in either array, then 1 would be
      incorrectly omitted from the result.
    - Fix error detection in "contrib/pgcrypto"'s encrypt_iv() and
      decrypt_iv().
      These functions failed to report certain types of invalid-input
      errors, and would instead return random garbage values for
      incorrect input.
    - Fix one-byte buffer overrun in "contrib/test_parser".
      The code would try to read one more byte than it should, which
      would crash in corner cases. Since "contrib/test_parser" is only
      example code, this is not a security issue in itself, but bad
      example code is still bad.
    - Use __sync_lock_test_and_set() for spinlocks on ARM, if available.
      This function replaces our previous use of the SWPB instruction,
      which is deprecated and not available on ARMv6 and later. Reports
      suggest that the old code doesn't fail in an obvious way on recent
      ARM boards, but simply doesn't interlock concurrent accesses,
      leading to bizarre failures in multiprocess operation.
    - Use "-fexcess-precision=standard" option when building with gcc
      versions that accept it.
      This prevents assorted scenarios wherein recent versions of gcc
      will produce creative results.
    - Allow use of threaded Python on FreeBSD.
      Our configure script previously believed that this combination
      wouldn't work; but FreeBSD fixed the problem, so remove that error
      check.

postgresql-8.4 (8.4.10-0squeeze1) stable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release:
    - Fix bugs in information_schema.referential_constraints view.
      This view was being insufficiently careful about matching the
      foreign-key constraint to the depended-on primary or unique key
      constraint. That could result in failure to show a foreign key
      constraint at all, or showing it multiple times, or claiming that
      it depends on a different constraint than the one it really does.
      Since the view definition is installed by initdb, merely upgrading
      will not fix the problem. If you need to fix this in an existing
      installation, you can (as a superuser) drop the information_schema
      schema then re-create it by sourcing
      "SHAREDIR/information_schema.sql". (Run pg_config --sharedir if
      you're uncertain where "SHAREDIR" is.) This must be repeated in
      each database to be fixed.
    - Fix incorrect replay of WAL records for GIN index updates.
      This could result in transiently failing to find index entries
      after a crash, or on a hot-standby server. The problem would be
      repaired by the next "VACUUM" of the index, however.
    - Fix TOAST-related data corruption during CREATE TABLE dest AS
      SELECT - FROM src or INSERT INTO dest SELECT * FROM src.
      If a table has been modified by "ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN", attempts
      to copy its data verbatim to another table could produce corrupt
      results in certain corner cases. The problem can only manifest in
      this precise form in 8.4 and later, but we patched earlier versions
      as well in case there are other code paths that could trigger the
      same bug.
    - Fix race condition during toast table access from stale syscache
      entries.
    - Track dependencies of functions on items used in parameter default
      expressions. Previously, a referenced object could be dropped without
      having dropped or modified the function, leading to misbehavior when the
      function was used. Note that merely installing this update will not fix
      the missing dependency entries; to do that, you'd need to "CREATE OR
      REPLACE" each such function afterwards. If you have functions whose
      defaults depend on non-built-in objects, doing so is recommended.
    - Allow inlining of set-returning SQL functions with multiple OUT
      parameters.
    - Make DatumGetInetP() unpack inet datums that have a 1-byte header,
      and add a new macro, DatumGetInetPP(), that does not.
    - Improve locale support in money type's input and output.
      Aside from not supporting all standard lc_monetary formatting
      options, the input and output functions were inconsistent, meaning
      there were locales in which dumped money values could not be
      re-read.
    - Don't let transform_null_equals affect CASE foo WHEN NULL ...
      constructs. transform_null_equals is only supposed to affect foo = NULL
      expressions written directly by the user, not equality checks
      generated internally by this form of CASE.
    - Change foreign-key trigger creation order to better support
      self-referential foreign keys. For a cascading foreign key that
      references its own table, a row update will fire both the ON UPDATE
      trigger and the CHECK trigger as one event. The ON UPDATE trigger must
      execute first, else the CHECK will check a non-final state of the row
      and possibly throw an inappropriate error. However, the firing order of
      these triggers is determined by their names, which generally sort in
      creation order since the triggers have auto-generated names following
      the convention "RI_ConstraintTrigger_NNNN". A proper fix would require
      modifying that convention, which we will do in 9.2, but it seems risky
      to change it in existing releases. So this patch just changes the
      creation order of the triggers. Users encountering this type of error
      should drop and re-create the foreign key constraint to get its triggers
      into the right order.
    - Avoid floating-point underflow while tracking buffer allocation
      rate.
    - Preserve blank lines within commands in psql's command history.
      The former behavior could cause problems if an empty line was
      removed from within a string literal, for example.
    - Fix pg_dump to dump user-defined casts between auto-generated
      types, such as table rowtypes.
    - Use the preferred version of xsubpp to build PL/Perl, not
      necessarily the operating system's main copy.
    - Fix incorrect coding in "contrib/dict_int" and "contrib/dict_xsyn".
    - Honor query cancel interrupts promptly in pgstatindex().
    - Ensure VPATH builds properly install all server header files.
    - Shorten file names reported in verbose error messages.
      Regular builds have always reported just the name of the C file
      containing the error message call, but VPATH builds formerly
      reported an absolute path name.

postgresql-8.4 (8.4.9-0squeeze1) stable-security; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix/security release:
     - Fix bugs in indexing of in-doubt HOT-updated tuples.
       These bugs could result in index corruption after reindexing a
       system catalog. They are not believed to affect user indexes.
     - Fix multiple bugs in GiST index page split processing.
       The probability of occurrence was low, but these could lead to
       index corruption.
     - Fix possible buffer overrun in tsvector_concat().
       The function could underestimate the amount of memory needed for
       its result, leading to server crashes.
     - Fix crash in xml_recv when processing a "standalone" parameter.
     - Make pg_options_to_table return NULL for an option with no value.
       Previously such cases would result in a server crash.
     - Avoid possibly accessing off the end of memory in "ANALYZE" and in
       SJIS-2004 encoding conversion.
       This fixes some very-low-probability server crash scenarios.
     - Prevent intermittent hang in interactions of startup process with
       bgwriter process.
       This affected recovery in non-hot-standby cases.
     - Fix race condition in relcache init file invalidation.
       There was a window wherein a new backend process could read a stale
       init file but miss the inval messages that would tell it the data
       is stale. The result would be bizarre failures in catalog accesses,
       typically "could not read block 0 in file ..." later during
       startup.
     - Fix memory leak at end of a GiST index scan.
       Commands that perform many separate GiST index scans, such as
       verification of a new GiST-based exclusion constraint on a table
       already containing many rows, could transiently require large
       amounts of memory due to this leak.
     - Fix incorrect memory accounting (leading to possible memory bloat)
       in tuplestores supporting holdable cursors and plpgsql's RETURN
       NEXT command.
     - Fix performance problem when constructing a large, lossy bitmap.
     - Fix join selectivity estimation for unique columns.
       This fixes an erroneous planner heuristic that could lead to poor
       estimates of the result size of a join.
     - Fix nested PlaceHolderVar expressions that appear only in
       sub-select target lists. This mistake could result in outputs of an
       outer join incorrectly appearing as NULL.
     - Allow nested EXISTS queries to be optimized properly.
     - Fix array- and path-creating functions to ensure padding bytes are
       zeroes.  This avoids some situations where the planner will think that
       semantically-equal constants are not equal, resulting in poor
       optimization.
     - Fix "EXPLAIN" to handle gating Result nodes within inner-indexscan
       subplans.  The usual symptom of this oversight was "bogus varno" errors.
     - Work around gcc 4.6.0 bug that breaks WAL replay.  This could lead to
       loss of committed transactions after a server crash.
     - Fix dump bug for VALUES in a view.
     - Disallow SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE on sequences.
       This operation doesn't work as expected and can lead to failures.
     - Fix "VACUUM" so that it always updates pg_class.reltuples/relpages.
       This fixes some scenarios where autovacuum could make increasingly
       poor decisions about when to vacuum tables.
     - Defend against integer overflow when computing size of a hash table.
     - Fix cases where "CLUSTER" might attempt to access already-removed
       TOAST data.
     - Fix portability bugs in use of credentials control messages for
       "peer" authentication.
     - Fix SSPI login when multiple roundtrips are required.
       The typical symptom of this problem was "The function requested is
       not supported" errors during SSPI login.
     - Throw an error if "pg_hba.conf" contains hostssl but SSL is
       disabled.  This was concluded to be more user-friendly than the
       previous behavior of silently ignoring such lines.
     - Fix typo in pg_srand48 seed initialization.
       This led to failure to use all bits of the provided seed. This
       function is not used on most platforms (only those without
       srandom), and the potential security exposure from a
       less-random-than-expected seed seems minimal in any case.
     - Avoid integer overflow when the sum of LIMIT and OFFSET values
       exceeds 2^63.
     - Add overflow checks to int4 and int8 versions of generate_series().
     - Fix trailing-zero removal in to_char().  In a format with FM and no
       digit positions after the decimal point, zeroes to the left of the
       decimal point could be removed incorrectly.
     - Fix pg_size_pretty() to avoid overflow for inputs close to 2^63.
     - Weaken plpgsql's check for typmod matching in record values.
       An overly enthusiastic check could lead to discarding length
       modifiers that should have been kept.
     - Fix pg_upgrade to preserve toast tables' relfrozenxids during an
       upgrade from 8.3. Failure to do this could lead to "pg_clog" files
       being removed too soon after the upgrade.
     - Fix psql's counting of script file line numbers during COPY from a
       different file.
     - Fix pg_restore's direct-to-database mode for
       standard_conforming_strings.  pg_restore could emit incorrect commands
       when restoring directly to a database server from an archive file that
       had been made with standard_conforming_strings set to on.
     - Be more user-friendly about unsupported cases for parallel
       pg_restore.  This change ensures that such cases are detected and
       reported before any restore actions have been taken.
     - Fix write-past-buffer-end and memory leak in libpq's LDAP service
       lookup code.
     - In libpq, avoid failures when using nonblocking I/O and an SSL
       connection.
     - Improve libpq's handling of failures during connection startup.
       In particular, the response to a server report of fork() failure
       during SSL connection startup is now saner.
     - Improve libpq's error reporting for SSL failures.
     - Fix PQsetvalue() to avoid possible crash when adding a new tuple to
       a PGresult originally obtained from a server query.
     - Make ecpglib write double values with 15 digits precision.
     - In ecpglib, be sure LC_NUMERIC setting is restored after an error.
     - Apply upstream fix for blowfish signed-character bug
       (CVE-2011-2483) (Closes: #631285)
       "contrib/pg_crypto"'s blowfish encryption code could give wrong
       results on platforms where char is signed (which is most), leading
       to encrypted passwords being weaker than they should be.
     - Fix memory leak in "contrib/seg".
     - Fix pgstatindex() to give consistent results for empty indexes.
     - Allow building with perl 5.14. (Closes: #628503)

  * New upstream bug fix release: (Closes: #626559)
    - If your installation was upgraded from a previous major release by
      running pg_upgrade, you should take action to prevent possible data loss
      due to a now-fixed bug in pg_upgrade. The recommended solution is to run
      "VACUUM FREEZE" on all TOAST tables.  More information is available at
      http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/20110408pg_upgrade_fix.
    - Fix pg_upgrade's handling of TOAST tables.
      This error poses a significant risk of data loss for installations
      that have been upgraded with pg_upgrade. This patch corrects the
      problem for future uses of pg_upgrade, but does not in itself cure
      the issue in installations that have been processed with a buggy
      version of pg_upgrade.
    - Suppress incorrect "PD_ALL_VISIBLE flag was incorrectly set"
      warning.
    - Disallow including a composite type in itself.
    - Avoid potential deadlock during catalog cache initialization.
    - Fix dangling-pointer problem in BEFORE ROW UPDATE trigger handling
      when there was a concurrent update to the target tuple.
    - Disallow "DROP TABLE" when there are pending deferred trigger
      events for the table.
      Formerly the "DROP" would go through, leading to "could not open
      relation with OID nnn" errors when the triggers were eventually
      fired.
    - Prevent crash triggered by constant-false WHERE conditions during
      GEQO optimization.
    - Improve planner's handling of semi-join and anti-join cases.
    - Fix selectivity estimation for text search to account for NULLs.
    - Improve PL/pgSQL's ability to handle row types with dropped columns.
    - Fix PL/Python memory leak involving array slices.
    - Fix pg_restore to cope with long lines (over 1KB) in TOC files.
    - Put in more safeguards against crashing due to division-by-zero
      with overly enthusiastic compiler optimization. (Closes: #616180)

postgresql-8.4 (8.4.7-0squeeze2) stable-security; urgency=low

  * New upstream security/bug fix release:
    - Fix buffer overrun in "contrib/intarray"'s input function for the
      query_int type.
      This bug is a security risk since the function's return address
      could be overwritten. Thanks to Apple Inc's security team for
      reporting this issue and supplying the fix. (CVE-2010-4015)
    - Avoid failures when "EXPLAIN" tries to display a simple-form CASE
      expression.
      If the CASE's test expression was a constant, the planner could
      simplify the CASE into a form that confused the expression-display
      code, resulting in "unexpected CASE WHEN clause" errors.
    - Fix assignment to an array slice that is before the existing range
      of subscripts.
      If there was a gap between the newly added subscripts and the first
      pre-existing subscript, the code miscalculated how many entries
      needed to be copied from the old array's null bitmap, potentially
      leading to data corruption or crash.
    - Avoid unexpected conversion overflow in planner for very distant
      date values.
      The date type supports a wider range of dates than can be
      represented by the timestamp types, but the planner assumed it
      could always convert a date to timestamp with impunity.
    - Fix pg_restore's text output for large objects (BLOBs) when
      standard_conforming_strings is on.
      Although restoring directly to a database worked correctly, string
      escaping was incorrect if pg_restore was asked for SQL text output
      and standard_conforming_strings had been enabled in the source
      database.
    - Fix erroneous parsing of tsquery values containing ... &
      !(subexpression) | ... .
      Queries containing this combination of operators were not executed
      correctly. The same error existed in "contrib/intarray"'s query_int
      type and "contrib/ltree"'s ltxtquery type.
    - Fix bug in "contrib/seg"'s GiST picksplit algorithm.
      This could result in considerable inefficiency, though not actually
      incorrect answers, in a GiST index on a seg column. If you have
      such an index, consider "REINDEX"ing it after installing this
      update. (This is identical to the bug that was fixed in
      "contrib/cube" in the previous update.)

postgresql-8.4 (8.4.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release:
    - Force the default wal_sync_method to be fdatasync on Linux.
      The default on Linux has actually been fdatasync for many years,
      but recent kernel changes caused PostgreSQL to choose open_datasync
      instead. This choice did not result in any performance improvement,
      and caused outright failures on certain filesystems, notably ext4
      with the data=journal mount option.
    - Fix assorted bugs in WAL replay logic for GIN indexes.
      This could result in "bad buffer id: 0" failures or corruption of
      index contents during replication.
    - Fix recovery from base backup when the starting checkpoint WAL
      record is not in the same WAL segment as its redo point.
    - Fix persistent slowdown of autovacuum workers when multiple workers
      remain active for a long time.
      The effective vacuum_cost_limit for an autovacuum worker could drop
      to nearly zero if it processed enough tables, causing it to run
      extremely slowly.
    - Add support for detecting register-stack overrun on IA64.
      The IA64 architecture has two hardware stacks. Full prevention of
      stack-overrun failures requires checking both.
    - Add a check for stack overflow in copyObject().
      Certain code paths could crash due to stack overflow given a
      sufficiently complex query.
    - Fix detection of page splits in temporary GiST indexes.
      It is possible to have a "concurrent" page split in a temporary
      index, if for example there is an open cursor scanning the index
      when an insertion is done. GiST failed to detect this case and
      hence could deliver wrong results when execution of the cursor
      continued.
    - Fix error checking during early connection processing.
      The check for too many child processes was skipped in some cases,
      possibly leading to postmaster crash when attempting to add the new
      child process to fixed-size arrays.
    - Improve efficiency of window functions.
      Certain cases where a large number of tuples needed to be read in
      advance, but work_mem was large enough to allow them all to be held
      in memory, were unexpectedly slow. percent_rank(), cume_dist() and
      ntile() in particular were subject to this problem.
    - Avoid memory leakage while "ANALYZE"'ing complex index expressions.
    - Ensure an index that uses a whole-row Var still depends on its
      table.
      An index declared like create index i on t (foo(t.-)) would not
      automatically get dropped when its table was dropped.
    - Do not "inline" a SQL function with multiple OUT parameters.
      This avoids a possible crash due to loss of information about the
      expected result rowtype.
    - Behave correctly if ORDER BY, LIMIT, FOR UPDATE, or WITH is
      attached to the VALUES part of INSERT ... VALUES.
    - Fix constant-folding of COALESCE() expressions.
      The planner would sometimes attempt to evaluate sub-expressions
      that in fact could never be reached, possibly leading to unexpected
      errors.
    - Fix postmaster crash when connection acceptance (accept() or one of
      the calls made immediately after it) fails, and the postmaster was
      compiled with GSSAPI support.
    - Fix missed unlink of temporary files when log_temp_files is active.
      If an error occurred while attempting to emit the log message, the
      unlink was not done, resulting in accumulation of temp files.
    - Add print functionality for InhRelation nodes.
      This avoids a failure when debug_print_parse is enabled and certain
      types of query are executed.
    - Fix incorrect calculation of distance from a point to a horizontal
      line segment.
      This bug affected several different geometric distance-measurement
      operators.
    - Fix incorrect calculation of transaction status in ecpg.
    - Fix PL/pgSQL's handling of "simple" expressions to not fail in
      recursion or error-recovery cases.
    - Fix PL/Python's handling of set-returning functions.
      Attempts to call SPI functions within the iterator generating a set
      result would fail.
    - Fix bug in "contrib/cube"'s GiST picksplit algorithm.
      This could result in considerable inefficiency, though not actually
      incorrect answers, in a GiST index on a cube column. If you have
      such an index, consider "REINDEX"ing it after installing this
      update.
    - Don't emit "identifier will be truncated" notices in
      "contrib/dblink" except when creating new connections.
    - Fix potential coredump on missing public key in "contrib/pgcrypto".
    - Fix memory leak in "contrib/xml2"'s XPath query functions.

postgresql-8.4 (8.4.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Urgency medium, since this fixes a security bug (but also a lot of other
    bugs, it's not a pinpointed patch).
  * New upstream security/bug fix update:
    - Use a separate interpreter for each calling SQL userid in PL/Perl
      and PL/Tcl.
      This change prevents security problems that can be caused by
      subverting Perl or Tcl code that will be executed later in the same
      session under another SQL user identity (for example, within a
      SECURITY DEFINER function). Most scripting languages offer numerous
      ways that that might be done, such as redefining standard functions
      or operators called by the target function. Without this change,
      any SQL user with Perl or Tcl language usage rights can do
      essentially anything with the SQL privileges of the target
      function's owner.
      The cost of this change is that intentional communication among
      Perl and Tcl functions becomes more difficult. To provide an escape
      hatch, PL/PerlU and PL/TclU functions continue to use only one
      interpreter per session. This is not considered a security issue
      since all such functions execute at the trust level of a database
      superuser already.
      It is likely that third-party procedural languages that claim to
      offer trusted execution have similar security issues. We advise
      contacting the authors of any PL you are depending on for
      security-critical purposes.
      Our thanks to Tim Bunce for pointing out this issue
      (CVE-2010-3433).
    - Prevent possible crashes in pg_get_expr() by disallowing it from
      being called with an argument that is not one of the system catalog
      columns it's intended to be used with.
    - Fix incorrect placement of placeholder evaluation.
      This bug could result in query outputs being non-null when they
      should be null, in cases where the inner side of an outer join is a
      sub-select with non-strict expressions in its output list.
    - Fix possible duplicate scans of UNION ALL member relations.
    - Fix "cannot handle unplanned sub-select" error.
      This occurred when a sub-select contains a join alias reference
      that expands into an expression containing another sub-select.
    - Fix mishandling of whole-row Vars that reference a view or
      sub-select and appear within a nested sub-select.
    - Fix mishandling of cross-type IN comparisons.
      This could result in failures if the planner tried to implement an
      IN join with a sort-then-unique-then-plain-join plan.
    - Fix computation of "ANALYZE" statistics for tsvector columns.
      The original coding could produce incorrect statistics, leading to
      poor plan choices later.
    - Improve planner's estimate of memory used by array_agg(),
      string_agg(), and similar aggregate functions.
      The previous drastic underestimate could lead to out-of-memory
      failures due to inappropriate choice of a hash-aggregation plan.
    - Fix failure to mark cached plans as transient.
      If a plan is prepared while "CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY" is in
      progress for one of the referenced tables, it is supposed to be
      re-planned once the index is ready for use. This was not happening
      reliably.
    - Reduce PANIC to ERROR in some occasionally-reported btree failure
      cases, and provide additional detail in the resulting error
      messages.
      This should improve the system's robustness with corrupted indexes.
    - Fix incorrect search logic for partial-match queries with GIN
      indexes.
      Cases involving AND/OR combination of several GIN index conditions
      didn't always give the right answer, and were sometimes much slower
      than necessary.
    - Prevent show_session_authorization() from crashing within
      autovacuum processes.
    - Defend against functions returning setof record where not all the
      returned rows are actually of the same rowtype.
    - Fix possible corruption of pending trigger event lists during
      subtransaction rollback.
      This could lead to a crash or incorrect firing of triggers.
    - Fix possible failure when hashing a pass-by-reference function
      result.
    - Improve merge join's handling of NULLs in the join columns.
      A merge join can now stop entirely upon reaching the first NULL, if
      the sort order is such that NULLs sort high.
    - Take care to fsync the contents of lockfiles (both "postmaster.pid"
      and the socket lockfile) while writing them.
      This omission could result in corrupted lockfile contents if the
      machine crashes shortly after postmaster start. That could in turn
      prevent subsequent attempts to start the postmaster from
      succeeding, until the lockfile is manually removed.
    - Avoid recursion while assigning XIDs to heavily-nested
      subtransactions.
      The original coding could result in a crash if there was limited
      stack space.
    - Avoid holding open old WAL segments in the walwriter process.
      The previous coding would prevent removal of no-longer-needed
      segments.
    - Fix log_line_prefix's %i escape, which could produce junk early in
      backend startup.
    - Prevent misinterpretation of partially-specified relation options
      for TOAST tables.
      In particular, fillfactor would be read as zero if any other
      reloption had been set for the table, leading to serious bloat.
    - Fix inheritance count tracking in "ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT"
    - Fix possible data corruption in "ALTER TABLE ... SET TABLESPACE"
      when archiving is enabled.
    - Allow "CREATE DATABASE" and "ALTER DATABASE ... SET TABLESPACE" to
      be interrupted by query-cancel.
    - Improve "CREATE INDEX"'s checking of whether proposed index
      expressions are immutable.
    - Fix "REASSIGN OWNED" to handle operator classes and families.
    - Fix possible core dump when comparing two empty tsquery values.
    - Fix LIKE's handling of patterns containing % followed by _.
      We've fixed this before, but there were still some
      incorrectly-handled cases.
    - Re-allow input of Julian dates prior to 0001-01-01 AD.
      Input such as 'J100000'::date worked before 8.4, but was
      unintentionally broken by added error-checking.
    - Fix PL/pgSQL to throw an error, not crash, if a cursor is closed
      within a FOR loop that is iterating over that cursor.
    - In PL/Python, defend against null pointer results from
      PyCObject_AsVoidPtr and PyCObject_FromVoidPtr.
    - In libpq, fix full SSL certificate verification for the case where
      both host and hostaddr are specified.
    - Make psql recognize "DISCARD ALL" as a command that should not be
      encased in a transaction block in autocommit-off mode.
    - Fix some issues in pg_dump's handling of SQL/MED objects.
      Notably, pg_dump would always fail if run by a non-superuser, which
      was not intended.
    - Improve pg_dump and pg_restore's handling of non-seekable archive
      files.
      This is important for proper functioning of parallel restore.
    - Improve parallel pg_restore's ability to cope with selective
      restore (-L option).
      The original code tended to fail if the -L file commanded a
      non-default restore ordering.
    - Fix ecpg to process data from RETURNING clauses correctly.
    - Fix some memory leaks in ecpg.
    - Improve "contrib/dblink"'s handling of tables containing dropped
      columns.
    - Fix connection leak after "duplicate connection name" errors in
      "contrib/dblink".
    - Fix "contrib/dblink" to handle connection names longer than 62
      bytes correctly.
    - Add hstore(text, text) function to "contrib/hstore".
      This function is the recommended substitute for the now-deprecated
      => operator. It was back-patched so that future-proofed code can be
      used with older server versions. Note that the patch will be
      effective only after "contrib/hstore" is installed or reinstalled
      in a particular database. Users might prefer to execute the "CREATE
      FUNCTION" command by hand, instead.
    - Update build infrastructure and documentation to reflect the source
      code repository's move from CVS to Git.

postgresql-8.4 (8.4.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Urgency medium due to security fixes.
  * New upstream security/bug fix release:
    - Enforce restrictions in plperl using an opmask applied to the whole
      interpreter, instead of using "Safe.pm".
      Recent developments have convinced us that "Safe.pm" is too
      insecure to rely on for making plperl trustable. This change
      removes use of "Safe.pm" altogether, in favor of using a separate
      interpreter with an opcode mask that is always applied. Pleasant
      side effects of the change include that it is now possible to use
      Perl's strict pragma in a natural way in plperl, and that Perl's $a
      and $b variables work as expected in sort routines, and that
      function compilation is significantly faster. (CVE-2010-1169)
    - Prevent PL/Tcl from executing untrustworthy code from pltcl_modules.
      PL/Tcl's feature for autoloading Tcl code from a database table
      could be exploited for trojan-horse attacks, because there was no
      restriction on who could create or insert into that table. This
      change disables the feature unless pltcl_modules is owned by a
      superuser. (However, the permissions on the table are not checked,
      so installations that really need a less-than-secure modules table
      can still grant suitable privileges to trusted non-superusers.)
      Also, prevent loading code into the unrestricted "normal" Tcl
      interpreter unless we are really going to execute a pltclu
      function. (CVE-2010-1170)
    - Fix data corruption during WAL replay of ALTER ... SET TABLESPACE.
      When archive_mode is on, ALTER ... SET TABLESPACE generates a WAL
      record whose replay logic was incorrect. It could write the data to
      the wrong place, leading to possibly-unrecoverable data corruption.
      Data corruption would be observed on standby slaves, and could
      occur on the master as well if a database crash and recovery
      occurred after committing the ALTER and before the next checkpoint.
    - Fix possible crash if a cache reset message is received during
      rebuild of a relcache entry.
      This error was introduced in 8.4.3 while fixing a related failure.
    - Apply per-function GUC settings while running the language
      validator for the function. This avoids failures if the function's code
      is invalid without the setting; an example is that SQL functions may not
      parse if the search_path is not correct.
    - Do constraint exclusion for inherited "UPDATE" and "DELETE" target
      tables when constraint_exclusion = partition.
      Due to an oversight, this setting previously only caused constraint
      exclusion to be checked in "SELECT" commands.
    - Do not allow an unprivileged user to reset superuser-only parameter
      settings.
      Previously, if an unprivileged user ran ALTER USER ... RESET ALL
      for himself, or ALTER DATABASE ... RESET ALL for a database he
      owns, this would remove all special parameter settings for the user
      or database, even ones that are only supposed to be changeable by a
      superuser. Now, the "ALTER" will only remove the parameters that
      the user has permission to change.
    - Avoid possible crash during backend shutdown if shutdown occurs
      when a CONTEXT addition would be made to log entries.
      In some cases the context-printing function would fail because the
      current transaction had already been rolled back when it came time
      to print a log message.
    - Fix erroneous handling of %r parameter in recovery_end_command.
      The value always came out zero.
    - Ensure the archiver process responds to changes in archive_command
      as soon as possible.
    - Fix pl/pgsql's CASE statement to not fail when the case expression
      is a query that returns no rows.
    - Update pl/perl's "ppport.h" for modern Perl versions.
    - Fix assorted memory leaks in pl/python.
    - Handle empty-string connect parameters properly in ecpg.
    - Prevent infinite recursion in psql when expanding a variable that
      refers to itself.
    - Fix psql's \copy to not add spaces around a dot within \copy
      (select ...).
      Addition of spaces around the decimal point in a numeric literal
      would result in a syntax error.
    - Avoid formatting failure in psql when running in a locale context
      that doesn't match the client_encoding.
    - Fix unnecessary "GIN indexes do not support whole-index scans"
      errors for unsatisfiable queries using "contrib/intarray" operators.
    - Ensure that "contrib/pgstattuple" functions respond to cancel
      interrupts promptly.

postgresql-8.4 (8.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release:
    - Add new configuration parameter ssl_renegotiation_limit to control
      how often we do session key renegotiation for an SSL connection.
      This can be set to zero to disable renegotiation completely, which
      may be required if a broken SSL library is used. In particular,
      some vendors are shipping stopgap patches for CVE-2009-3555 that
      cause renegotiation attempts to fail.
    - Fix possible deadlock during backend startup.
    - Fix possible crashes due to not handling errors during relcache
      reload cleanly.
    - Fix possible crash due to use of dangling pointer to a cached plan.
    - Fix possible crash due to overenthusiastic invalidation of cached
      plan for "ROLLBACK".
    - Fix possible crashes when trying to recover from a failure in
      subtransaction start.
    - Fix server memory leak associated with use of savepoints and a
      client encoding different from server's encoding.
    - Fix incorrect WAL data emitted during end-of-recovery cleanup of a
      GIST index page split.
    - Fix bug in WAL redo cleanup method for GIN indexes.
    - Fix incorrect comparison of scan key in GIN index search.
    - Make substring() for bit types treat any negative length as meaning
      "all the rest of the string". The previous coding treated only -1 that
      way, and would produce an invalid result value for other negative
      values, possibly leading to a crash (CVE-2010-0442).
    - Fix integer-to-bit-string conversions to handle the first
      fractional byte correctly when the output bit width is wider than
      the given integer by something other than a multiple of 8 bits.
    - Fix some cases of pathologically slow regular expression matching.
    - Fix bug occurring when trying to inline a SQL function that returns
      a set of a composite type that contains dropped columns.
    - Fix bug with trying to update a field of an element of a
      composite-type array column.
    - Avoid failure when "EXPLAIN" has to print a FieldStore or
      assignment ArrayRef expression.
      These cases can arise now that "EXPLAIN VERBOSE" tries to print
      plan node target lists.
    - Avoid an unnecessary coercion failure in some cases where an
      undecorated literal string appears in a subquery within
      "UNION"/"INTERSECT"/"EXCEPT".
      This fixes a regression for some cases that worked before 8.4.
    - Avoid undesirable rowtype compatibility check failures in some
      cases where a whole-row Var has a rowtype that contains dropped
      columns.
    - Fix the STOP WAL LOCATION entry in backup history files to report
      the next WAL segment's name when the end location is exactly at a
      segment boundary.
    - Always pass the catalog ID to an option validator function
      specified in "CREATE FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER".
    - Fix some more cases of temporary-file leakage.
      This corrects a problem introduced in the previous minor release.
      One case that failed is when a plpgsql function returning set is
      called within another function's exception handler.
    - Add support for doing FULL JOIN ON FALSE.
      This prevents a regression from pre-8.4 releases for some queries
      that can now be simplified to a constant-false join condition.
    - Improve constraint exclusion processing of boolean-variable cases,
      in particular make it possible to exclude a partition that has a
      "bool_column = false" constraint.
    - Prevent treating an INOUT cast as representing binary compatibility.
    - Include column name in the message when warning about inability to
      grant or revoke column-level privileges.
      This is more useful than before and helps to prevent confusion when
      a "REVOKE" generates multiple messages, which formerly appeared to
      be duplicates.
    - When reading "pg_hba.conf" and related files, do not treat
      @something as a file inclusion request if the @ appears inside
      quote marks; also, never treat @ by itself as a file inclusion
      request.
      This prevents erratic behavior if a role or database name starts
      with @. If you need to include a file whose path name contains
      spaces, you can still do so, but you must write @"/path to/file"
      rather than putting the quotes around the whole construct.
    - Prevent infinite loop on some platforms if a directory is named as
      an inclusion target in "pg_hba.conf" and related files.
    - Fix possible infinite loop if SSL_read or SSL_write fails without
      setting errno.
      This is reportedly possible with some Windows versions of openssl.
    - Disallow GSSAPI authentication on local connections, since it
      requires a hostname to function correctly.
    - Protect ecpg against applications freeing strings unexpectedly.
    - Make ecpg report the proper SQLSTATE if the connection disappears.
    - Fix translation of cell contents in psql \d output.
    - Fix psql's numericlocale option to not format strings it shouldn't
      in latex and troff output formats.
    - Fix a small per-query memory leak in psql.
    - Make psql return the correct exit status (3) when ON_ERROR_STOP and
      --single-transaction are both specified and an error occurs during
      the implied "COMMIT".
    - Fix pg_dump's output of permissions for foreign servers.
    - Fix possible crash in parallel pg_restore due to out-of-range
      dependency IDs.
    - Fix plpgsql failure in one case where a composite column is set to
      NULL.
    - Fix possible failure when calling PL/Perl functions from PL/PerlU
      or vice versa.
    - Add volatile markings in PL/Python to avoid possible
      compiler-specific misbehavior>
    - Ensure PL/Tcl initializes the Tcl interpreter.
      The only known symptom of this oversight is that the Tcl clock
      command misbehaves if using Tcl 8.5 or later.
    - Prevent ExecutorEnd from being run on portals created within a
      failed transaction or subtransaction.
      This is known to cause issues when using "contrib/auto_explain".
    - Prevent crash in "contrib/dblink" when too many key columns are
      specified to a dblink_build_sql_- function.
    - Allow zero-dimensional arrays in "contrib/ltree" operations.
      This case was formerly rejected as an error, but it's more
      convenient to treat it the same as a zero-element array. In
      particular this avoids unnecessary failures when an ltree operation
      is applied to the result of ARRAY(SELECT ...) and the sub-select
      returns no rows.
    - Fix assorted crashes in "contrib/xml2" caused by sloppy memory
      management.

postgresql-8.4 (8.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Medium urgency due to security fixes.

  [ Peter Eisentraut ]
  * debian/control: Added Homepage
  * debian/control: Added ${misc:Depends} on all packages, per lintian
  * debian/control: Added versioned dependencies on the shared libraries used 
    by the libecpg-dev package
  * debian/control: Removed obsolete build dependency bzip2
  * debian/control: Added Vcs fields

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * New upstream security/bug fix release:
    - Protect against indirect security threats caused by index functions
      changing session-local state. This change prevents allegedly-immutable
      index functions from possibly subverting a superuser's session
      (CVE-2009-4136).
    - Reject SSL certificates containing an embedded null byte in the
      common name (CN) field. This prevents unintended matching of a
      certificate to a server or client name during SSL validation
      (CVE-2009-4034).
    - Fix hash index corruption. The 8.4 change that made hash indexes keep
      entries sorted by hash value failed to update the bucket splitting and
      compaction routines to preserve the ordering. So application of either
      of those operations could lead to permanent corruption of an index, in
      the sense that searches might fail to find entries that are present. To
      deal with this, it is recommended to REINDEX any hash indexes you may
      have after installing this update.
    - Fix possible crash during backend-startup-time cache initialization.
    - Avoid crash on empty thesaurus dictionary.
    - Prevent signals from interrupting VACUUM at unsafe times.
    - Fix possible crash due to integer overflow in hash table size
      calculation.
    - Fix crash if a DROP is attempted on an internally-dependent object.
    - Fix very rare crash in inet/cidr comparisons.
    - Ensure that shared tuple-level locks held by prepared transactions
      are not ignored.
    - Fix premature drop of temporary files used for a cursor that is
      accessed within a subtransaction.
    - Fix memory leak in syslogger process when rotating to a new CSV
      logfile.
    - Fix memory leak in postmaster when re-parsing "pg_hba.conf".
    - Make FOR UPDATE/SHARE in the primary query not propagate into WITH
      queries.
    - Fix bug with a WITH RECURSIVE query immediately inside another one.
    - Fix concurrency bug in hash indexes.
    - Fix incorrect logic for GiST index page splits, when the split
      depends on a non-first column of the index.
    - Fix wrong search results for a multi-column GIN index with
      fastupdate enabled.
    - Fix bugs in WAL entry creation for GIN indexes.
    - Don't error out if recycling or removing an old WAL file fails at
      the end of checkpoint.
    - Fix PAM password processing to be more robust.
      The previous code is known to fail with the combination of the
      Linux pam_krb5 PAM module with Microsoft Active Directory as the
      domain controller. It might have problems elsewhere too, since it
      was making unjustified assumptions about what arguments the PAM
      stack would pass to it.
    - Raise the maximum authentication token (Kerberos ticket) size in
      GSSAPI and SSPI authentication methods. While the old 2000-byte limit
      was more than enough for Unix Kerberos implementations, tickets issued
      by Windows Domain Controllers can be much larger.
    - Ensure that domain constraints are enforced in constructs like
      ARRAY[...]::domain, where the domain is over an array type.
    - Fix foreign-key logic for some cases involving composite-type
      columns as foreign keys.
    - Ensure that a cursor's snapshot is not modified after it is created.
    - Fix CREATE TABLE to properly merge default expressions coming from
      different inheritance parent tables. This used to work but was broken in
      8.4.
    - Re-enable collection of access statistics for sequences. This used to
      work but was broken in 8.3.
    - Fix processing of ownership dependencies during CREATE OR REPLACE
      FUNCTION.
    - Fix incorrect handling of WHERE "x"="x" conditions.
      In some cases these could get ignored as redundant, but they aren't
      -- they're equivalent to "x" IS NOT NULL.
    - Fix incorrect plan construction when using hash aggregation to
      implement DISTINCT for textually identical volatile expressions
    - Fix Assert failure for a volatile SELECT DISTINCT ON expression
    - Fix ts_stat() to not fail on an empty tsvector value
    - Make text search parser accept underscores in XML attributes
    - Fix encoding handling in xml binary input.
      If the XML header doesn't specify an encoding, we now assume UTF-8
      by default; the previous handling was inconsistent.
    - Fix bug with calling plperl from plperlu or vice versa.
    - Fix session-lifespan memory leak when a PL/Perl function is
      redefined.
    - Ensure that Perl arrays are properly converted to PostgreSQL arrays
      when returned by a set-returning PL/Perl function.
    - Fix rare crash in exception processing in PL/Python.
    - Fix ecpg problem with comments in DECLARE CURSOR statements
    - Fix ecpg to not treat recently-added keywords as reserved words
      This affected the keywords CALLED, CATALOG, DEFINER, ENUM,
      FOLLOWING, INVOKER, OPTIONS, PARTITION, PRECEDING, RANGE, SECURITY,
      SERVER, UNBOUNDED, and WRAPPER.
    - Re-allow regular expression special characters in psql's \df
      function name parameter.
    - Put FREEZE and VERBOSE options in the right order in the VACUUM
      command that "contrib/vacuumdb" produces.
    - Fix possible leak of connections when "contrib/dblink" encounters
      an error
    - Make the postmaster ignore any application_name parameter in
      connection request packets, to improve compatibility with future
      libpq versions.

postgresql-8.4 (8.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Urgency medium due to security fix.
  * New upstream security/bug fix release:
    - Disallow "RESET ROLE" and "RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" inside
      security-definer functions. This covers a case that was missed in the
      previous patch that disallowed "SET ROLE" and "SET SESSION
      AUTHORIZATION" inside security-definer functions. [CVE-2007-6600]
    - Fix WAL page header initialization at the end of archive recovery.
      This could lead to failure to process the WAL in a subsequent archive
      recovery.
    - Fix "cannot make new WAL entries during recovery" error.
    - Fix problem that could make expired rows visible after a crash.
      This bug involved a page status bit potentially not being set
      correctly after a server crash.
    - Make "LOAD" of an already-loaded loadable module into a no-op.
      Formerly, "LOAD" would attempt to unload and re-load the module,
      but this is unsafe and not all that useful.
    - Make window function PARTITION BY and ORDER BY items always be
      interpreted as simple expressions.
      In 8.4.0 these lists were parsed following the rules used for
      top-level GROUP BY and ORDER BY lists. But this was not correct per
      the SQL standard, and it led to possible circularity.
    - Fix several errors in planning of semi-joins. These led to wrong query
      results in some cases where IN or EXISTS was used together with another
      join.
    - Fix handling of whole-row references to subqueries that are within
      an outer join. An example is SELECT COUNT(ss.-) FROM ... LEFT JOIN
      (SELECT ...) ss ON .... Here, ss.- would be treated as
      ROW(NULL,NULL,...) for null-extended join rows, which is not the same as
      a simple NULL.  Now it is treated as a simple NULL.
    - Fix locale handling with plperl. This bug could cause the server's
      locale setting to change when a plperl function is called, leading to
      data corruption.
    - Fix handling of reloptions to ensure setting one option doesn't
      force default values for others.
    - Ensure that a "fast shutdown" request will forcibly terminate open
      sessions, even if a "smart shutdown" was already in progress.
    - Avoid memory leak for array_agg() in GROUP BY queries.
    - Treat to_char(..., 'TH') as an uppercase ordinal suffix with
      'HH'/'HH12'.  It was previously handled as 'th'.
    - Include the fractional part in the result of EXTRACT(second) and
      EXTRACT(milliseconds) for time and time with time zone inputs.
      This has always worked for floating-point datetime configurations,
      but was broken in the integer datetime code.
    - Fix overflow for INTERVAL 'x ms' when "x" is more than 2 million
      and integer datetimes are in use.
    - Improve performance when processing toasted values in index scans.
      This is particularly useful for PostGIS.
    - Fix a typo that disabled commit_delay.
    - Output early-startup messages to "postmaster.log" if the server is
      started in silent mode. Previously such error messages were discarded,
      leading to difficulty in debugging.
    - Remove translated FAQs. They are now on the wiki. The main FAQ was moved
      to the wiki some time ago.
    - Fix pg_ctl to not go into an infinite loop if "postgresql.conf" is
      empty.
    - Fix several errors in pg_dump's --binary-upgrade mode. pg_dump
      --binary-upgrade is used by pg_migrator.
    - Fix "contrib/xml2"'s xslt_process() to properly handle the maximum
      number of parameters (twenty).
    - Improve robustness of libpq's code to recover from errors during
      "COPY FROM STDIN".
    - Avoid including conflicting readline and editline header files when
      both libraries are installed.
    - Work around gcc bug that causes "floating-point exception" instead
      of "division by zero" on some platforms.
